# pygame_rpg
Rpg game made using pygame, entirely intended as a demostration and not an actual product. (WIP)

This game was made following the tutorial provided by the
the youtube ClearCode in the following link:
--https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU1pPzEGrqw--

Only python default libraries with the obvius exception been pygame were used on this proyect, so i wont be bothering with a virtual enviroment nor with a requierements file.

All credits goes to him for the awesome tutorial, but that
does not mean that this version is entirely a copy of his,
in the original, assets routes where implemented using a simple file route to the asset, in this one i use the join method from the "os" library so it works in any os (as opposed to only mac).

Additionaly several sections of the code differ from the original as throught the process of following the tutorial my understanding of the code involved grew and i started to code a few things with my own style, then again nothing too significant and as i said before all credit to ClearCode.

Feel free to use this code as you see fit and to give proper credits. For all other files related to this game you can find them in the description of the tutorial.
